Codecademy pair project w/ Connor Alexander

<notes: 
I found that I could only work with the files in VS Code when I changed the filename. I was also not able to use the javascript function in a web-browser. I was able to download an extension for VS Code that creates a virtual server space for it run in to verify that it works.

I belive there is a more concice way to concate the two oject arrays in newMain.mjs; perhaps using .map, but i was able to get the function to work as needed.

CSS Applied using image hosted remotely. index.html has changed, main.js is unedited but now redundent.
